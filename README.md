# ⚙️ Working Principle

Robot continuously scans for fire using 3 flame sensors.
Upon fire detection:
Robot moves toward fire.
Stops at safe distance.
Activates water pump to extinguish the fire.
Sends status to user via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi (IoT-enabled).
Manual override possible through Bluetooth control (optional).
